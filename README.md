- Inventory management with automatic updates on product quantity and stock status.
- Validation implemented using **Zod** for clean and structured input handling.
- Revenue calculation with MongoDB aggregation pipeline.
- Error handling with detailed and user-friendly error messages.

## Validation with Zod

Zod has been implemented to ensure robust input validation for both products and orders. The validation handles:

- **Stationery Products**: Validates required fields like `name`, `brand`, `price`, `category`, `description`, `quantity`, and `inStock`.
- **Orders**: Validates fields like `email`, `product`, `quantity`, and `totalPrice`.

---

## Error Handling

Detailed error responses are returned in case of:

- Validation errors (e.g., invalid email, price below 0).
- Not Found errors for products or orders.
- Insufficient stock errors during order placement.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Express.js** for server-side application.
- **TypeScript** for type safety.
- **MongoDB** for database.
- **Mongoose** for schema definitions and database operations.
- **Zod** for validation.
- **Node.js** runtime.
